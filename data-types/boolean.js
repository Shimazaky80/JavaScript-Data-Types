// The Boolean type has ONLY two values: true and false
let nameFieldChecked = true // yes, name field is checked
console.log(nameFieldChecked, typeof nameFieldChecked)

let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked
console.log(ageFieldChecked, typeof ageFieldChecked)

// Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons:
let isGreater = 4 > 1;
console.log( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is "yes")
